/**
 * This module wraps a focused slice of desktop commands behind a typed front-end client.
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * - The `backend-client` layer keeps page components from having to know raw command names or transport details.
 * - If a route needs desktop data, start here before reaching for legacy preview helpers.
 *
 * Main declarations:
 * - `updateClient`
 *
 * Source-of-truth notes:
 * - Transport boundaries are defined by `docs/architecture/desktop-command-surface.md`.
 * - This layer should stay typed, boring, and free of user-facing copy so routes can keep ownership of UX decisions.
